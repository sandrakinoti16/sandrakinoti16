# Hey, I’m Sandra 👋

**Applied Computer Science student | Exploring Cybersecurity & AI | Learning in public**

I’m currently building a foundation in cybersecurity and AI while studying Applied Computer Science.  
Right now, I’m learning the basics — Linux, networking, Python, and beginner-friendly security labs.  
I’m documenting what I learn here as small projects and notes so I can grow consistently and share progress.

---

## 🌱 What I’m focusing on right now
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (TryHackMe beginner path, networking basics)
- Python scripting and automation
- Simple AI concepts (data preprocessing, basic classifiers)
- Learning Git & GitHub properly and contributing to open-source in the future

---

## 🧰 Tools I’m using and learning
- **Languages:** Python (beginner), Bash basics  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, Nmap, Wireshark  
- **Platforms:** Windows + WSL, TryHackMe, GitHub

## 📘 My learning projects
*(Coming soon — I’m starting small and building from there)*  
- `learning-journal` — Notes, commands, and reflections from my cybersecurity and AI learning journey  
- `first-python-tools` — Small scripts I write to understand Python fundamentals  
- `tryhackme-notes` — My walkthroughs and summaries from learning rooms  

---

## 🧭 Goals
- Build consistency: 2 focused hours a day for learning & projects  
- Finish the TryHackMe Pre-Security & Complete Beginner paths  
- Push one small project or learning update to GitHub each week  
- Attend tech meetups (starting with Google DevFest Nairobi 🚀)
